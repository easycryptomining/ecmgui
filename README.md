* nvidia-smi on the rig (for Nvidia card) : Should be installed with proprietary GPU drivers

## Install
### Nginx
This GUI is meant to be run on a secure and private LAN as there is no authentification process in it. If you plan to open the GUI to the world, it's strongly suggested that you implement HTTP Authentication :
